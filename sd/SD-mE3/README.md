# gRPC supplier

This is a gRPC example application, composed of three modules:
- [contract](contract/) - protocol buffers definition
- [server](server/) - implementation of service
- [client](client/) - invocation of service

The example can be extended with additional data in the messages and with security protections.

See the README for each module.

Start at contract, then go to server, and finally go to the client.
